    detail:
      "Part 1 — capture: connect a transcription notetaker (Otter.ai, Fireflies, Read AI) to your bookings. When a session starts, it joins, transcribes, and produces full meeting minutes and a summary — automatically. Part 2 — draft: connect Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT to your #NotesApp account via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Drop a raw idea, or hand it that meeting summary, and it reads your own past notes for context — your topics, structure, phrasing — and finishes the draft as if you'd researched and written it yourself, not in generic AI voice. This is steps 7–9 of the Value Loop (Capture → Refine → Publish Again), automated end to end: session → transcript → draft, ready to review and publish.",
